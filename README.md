# Antz

A program using ant colony optimizations algorithm to solve the travelling salesman problem.
GUI was made in windows forms.
Algorithm is available with pure C# and Assembly with C# frame using SIMD instructions.
Certain elements of the program use C++ SIMD implementation.
The result is calculated and the routes are displayed and highlighted based on their usage.
List of points to be used as cities is taken from a text file.

In a future:
- add more user control to the behavior of the simulated agents and visibility
- add a custom input file option
